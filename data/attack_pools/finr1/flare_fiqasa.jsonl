{"index": 0, "source_input": "What is the sentiment of the following financial post: Positive, Negative, or Neutral?\nText: $BBRY Actually lost .03c per share if U incl VZ as no debt and 3.1 in Cash.\nAnswer:", "gold_label": "negative", "choices": ["negative", "positive", "neutral"], "model_output": "To determine the sentiment of the provided financial post, let's analyze the text step by step.\n\nThe text states: \"$BBRY Actually lost .03c per share if U incl VZ as no debt and 3.1 in Cash.\"\n\nBreaking this down:\n- \"$BBRY\" likely refers to BlackBerry (BBRY) in financial terms.\n- \"Actually lost .03c per share\" indicates a negative performance, as the company experienced a loss of 3 cents per share.\n- The conditional part (\"if U incl VZ\") suggests including Verizon (VZ) in some calculation. However, the exact context isn't entirely clear here. It might be referring to adjusting the debt or cash position by including Verizon's data. The mention of \"no debt\" and \"3.1 in Cash\" could imply that by excluding debt (as Verizon might have lower debt), the adjusted value is higher. But the way it's phrased is a bit unclear.\n- The overall structure seems to present two scenarios: the actual loss of 3 cents, and a hypothetical scenario where VZ is included, resulting in no debt and 3.1 in cash. However, the connection between these two parts isn't explicitly stated. The user might be pointing out that including VZ's metrics changes the valuation or debt/cash position, but the exact relationship isn't clear without more context.\n\nGiven the explicit mention of a loss (.03c per share), which is a negative figure, the primary sentiment here is negative. The inclusion of VZ's data as a hypothetical scenario doesn't change the fact that the actual loss is reported. Therefore, the overall sentiment of the post is Negative."}
